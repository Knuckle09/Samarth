This is a Python script that performs calories burnt prediction using machine learning. The script incorporates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment into a simple Tkinter GUI for user interaction.

Tech Stack:
1. Libraries:
i)Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
ii)NumPy:Provides support for numerical operations.
iii)Seaborn and Matplotlib:Utilized for data visualization.
iv)Scikit-learn:Includes various machine learning tools like preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
v)XGBoost: A popular gradient boosting library used for regression tasks.
vi)RandomForestRegressor:Part of the Scikit-learn library, used for building random forest regression models.
vii)Tkinter:Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for building interactive applications.

2.Data Processing:
i)The script reads data from CSV files using Pandas.
ii)It checks for null values and duplicates in the dataset.
iii)Basic analysis and visualization of numerical and categorical columns are performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

3.Machine Learning Models:
i)Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, and XGBRegressor are employed for predicting calories burnt.
ii)Cross-validation is used for model evaluation.

4.Model Deployment:
i)The trained XGBRegressor model is encapsulated in a Scikit-learn Pipeline.
ii)The trained model is saved to a file using the pickle library.
iii)A Tkinter-based GUI is created for user input, and the saved model is loaded for predictions.

Improvements:
1.GUI Enhancement:
i)Consider adding labels and organizing the GUI layout for a more user-friendly experience.
ii)Include error handling for user input.

2.Model Selection:
Allow users to choose between different machine learning models in the GUI.

3.Data Validation:
Implement input validation to ensure that the user provides valid and expected input.

4.Visualization:
Enhance data visualization by incorporating more informative plots.

5.Logging:
Implement logging to capture and store relevant information during model training and prediction.

6.Documentation:
Provide inline comments and documentation for better code understanding and maintainability.

7.Error Handling:
Add robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected issues gracefully.
